Hyper-V Labs

This is a project I'm working on for my College Class. The diagram depicts my Hyper-V lab I've set up. Right now I have 2 servers, running windows 2016 server. One Server is the DC running DNS. I have a client with windows 10 pro added to the domain and a couple of accounts setup in Active Directory. The second server has DNS, DHCP and a iSCSi file share.
