Hyper-V Labs

This is a project I'm working on. The diagram depicts my Hyper-V lab I've set up. Nothing special, but it's a start that I can call my own. One DC running Active Directory, another Server running DNS, DHCP, iSCI and a Windows 10 Client. I'm moving to Azure soon, my computer can barely handle the three.
